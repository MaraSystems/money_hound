# 🐶 Money Hound

*Sniffing out fraud in real-time.*

## 📌 Project Overview

Money Hound is a **live fraud detection system** designed to monitor and classify mobile money transactions in real-time.

It uses a **synthetic transaction dataset** generated to mimic the Nigerian financial ecosystem (airtime, transfers, bills, POS, and mobile banking). Our system blends **unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)** with **supervised machine learning (XGBoost Regressor)** to catch suspicious transaction patterns before they escalate.

This project was built as part of a **Data Science Hackathon competition**.

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Live Fraud Detection**: Identify anomalies in streaming transactions.
* **Hybrid Modeling**: Combine **Isolation Forest** with **XGBoost** for robust detection.
* **Data-Driven Insights**: Explore transaction patterns using Pandas & Seaborn.
* **Scalable Architecture**: Ready to extend for real-world banking integrations.
